• Compared AutoML algorithms including H2O, Light AutoML, and Scikit-Learn Logistic Regression and Random Forest 
algorithms based on how accurately each algorithm performed in classifying target variable


• Trained and tested ML models using Cat-in-dat Kaggle competitions categorical dataset. Conducted data cleaning, feature 
engineering steps such as encoding, mapping. Examined results of encoding data with One Hot encoding and Target encoding


• Improved accuracy of SK-Learn Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithm by tuning hyperparameters. Scikit-Learns 
Logistic Regression model outperformed both H2O, Light AutoML models
